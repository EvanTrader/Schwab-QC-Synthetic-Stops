A sophisticated solution for Charles Schwab's stop order restrictions in QuantConnect algorithms. This library provides high-frequency monitoring and automatic market order execution when Schwab rejects stop orders within the bid-ask spread.

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Charles Schwab rejects stop orders** when the stop price falls within the current bid-ask spread. This creates a significant challenge for algorithmic traders who rely on precise stop loss execution for risk management.

**Traditional approaches fail because:**
- Stop orders get rejected with "stop price must be outside bid-ask spread" errors
- Market orders execute immediately at potentially worse prices
- Manual monitoring is impractical for high-frequency strategies

**Our solution:**
- **Automatic detection** of Schwab's specific rejection messages
- **High-frequency monitoring** (second resolution) of price movements
- **Intelligent execution** with stop market orders when possible, market orders when necessary
- **Broker-agnostic design** that only activates on Schwab rejections

## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Schwab Rejection Detection**: Automatically identifies Schwab's stop order rejection messages
- **High-Frequency Monitoring**: Uses second-resolution data for precise price tracking
- **Dual Execution Strategy**: Places stop market orders when bid tightens, market orders when price crosses target
- **Backup Stop System**: Ensures positions are fully protected with backup stops and synthetic monitoring
- **Position Validation**: Ensures synthetic stops match actual portfolio positions
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents infinite monitoring with configurable timeouts

### Advanced Features
- **Price Improvement Detection**: Adjusts stop levels based on better-than-expected fills
- **Dead Stock Handling**: Automatically removes monitoring for stocks with invalid prices
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of monitoring resources
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and performance analysis

### Broker Compatibility
- **Charles Schwab**: Full synthetic stops support with automatic activation
- **Other Brokers**: Standard stop orders work normally (no synthetic overhead)
- **Easy Switching**: Change brokers with a single line of code

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Synthetic Entry Flow
```
1. Place Stop Order ‚Üí 2. Schwab Rejects ‚Üí 3. Add to Synthetic Monitoring
                                    ‚Üì
4. High-Frequency Price Check ‚Üí 5. Bid Tightens? ‚Üí 6. Place Stop Market Order
                                    ‚Üì
7. Price Crosses Target? ‚Üí 8. Execute Market Order
```

### Synthetic Stop Flow
```
1. Place Stop Loss ‚Üí 2. Schwab Rejects ‚Üí 3. Add to Synthetic Monitoring
                                    ‚Üì
4. High-Frequency Price Check ‚Üí 5. Ask/Bid Tightens? ‚Üí 6. Place Stop Market Order
                                    ‚Üì
7. Price Crosses Target? ‚Üí 8. Execute Market Order (Exit Position)
```

### Data Structures
- **SyntheticEntry**: Tracks entry orders with target price, quantity, timeout
- **SyntheticStop**: Tracks stop loss orders with position validation
- **SchwabSyntheticStops**: Main handler class with monitoring logic

### Backup Stop System
The ORB example includes a comprehensive backup stop system that ensures positions are always protected:

- **Position Validation**: Continuously validates that stop orders match actual portfolio positions
- **Stop Updates**: Automatically updates stop orders when position sizes change
- **Backup Stops**: Places additional stop orders if primary stop updates fail
- **Synthetic Fallback**: Uses synthetic monitoring for any uncovered shares
- **Emergency Exits**: Market orders for remaining positions if backup stops fail

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Basic Integration

```python
from synthetic_stops import SchwabSyntheticStops

class MyAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        # Initialize synthetic stops handler
        self.synthetic_stops = SchwabSyntheticStops(self)
        
        # Set up Schwab brokerage
        self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.CharlesSchwab, AccountType.Margin)
    
    def OnData(self, data):
        # Process synthetic stops on high-frequency data
        if data.Time.second != 0:
            self.synthetic_stops.process_synthetic_entries(data)
            self.synthetic_stops.process_synthetic_stops(data)
            return
        
        # Your main strategy logic here
        pass
    
    def OnOrderEvent(self, order_event):
        # Handle Schwab rejections
        if order_event.Status == OrderStatus.Invalid:
            if self.synthetic_stops.is_schwab_rejection(order_event.Message):
                self.HandleSchwabRejection(order_event)
```

### Complete ORB Example

See `orb_example.py` for a full Opening Range Breakout implementation that demonstrates:
- Universe selection (top 500 stocks by volume)
- ORB entry logic with synthetic stops
- Risk management with ATR-based stops
- Daily position management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Algorithm Parameters
```python
# Risk management
self.stop_loss_risk_size = 0.01  # 1% portfolio risk per position
self.stop_loss_atr_distance = 0.1  # ATR multiplier for stop distance

# Synthetic stops
self.synthetic_timeout_minutes = 10  # Full trading day timeout
self.price_tolerance = 0.01  # Price tolerance for stop placement
```

### Brokerage Settings
```python
# For Schwab (with synthetic stops)
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.CharlesSchwab, AccountType.Margin)

# For other brokers (standard stops)
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Alpaca, AccountType.Margin)
```

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Computational Overhead
- **Minimal impact** when not using Schwab (no synthetic monitoring)
- **Second-resolution data** only for symbols with rejected orders
- **Automatic cleanup** prevents memory leaks
- **Efficient filtering** with early exit conditions

### Execution Quality
- **Better fills** through stop market orders when possible
- **Guaranteed execution** through market orders when necessary
- **Price improvement** detection and stop adjustment
- **Reduced slippage** compared to immediate market orders

### Risk Management
- **Position validation** ensures synthetic stops match portfolio
- **Timeout protection** prevents infinite monitoring
- **Dead stock detection** handles invalid price scenarios
- **Backup stop system** for failed order updates

## üîÆ Extensibility & Future Development

### Schwab Developer Portal Integration
While this implementation is designed for QuantConnect, the core synthetic stop logic can be adapted for Schwab's Developer Portal:

```python
# Future integration possibilities
class SchwabDirectSyntheticStops:
    """Direct integration with Schwab's Developer Portal APIs"""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key, account_id):
        self.schwab_api = SchwabAPI(api_key, account_id)
        self.synthetic_monitor = SyntheticStopMonitor()
    
    def handle_rejection(self, order_id, rejection_reason):
        # Direct API integration for synthetic monitoring
        pass
```

### Multi-Broker Support
The architecture supports easy extension to other brokers with similar restrictions:

```python
class BrokerAgnosticSyntheticStops:
    """Extensible synthetic stops for multiple brokers"""
    
    def __init__(self, broker_name):
        self.broker = self._get_broker_handler(broker_name)
        self.rejection_patterns = self._load_rejection_patterns()
    
    def _get_broker_handler(self, broker_name):
        handlers = {
            'schwab': SchwabHandler(),
            'fidelity': FidelityHandler(),
            'etrade': ETradeHandler()
        }
        return handlers.get(broker_name)
```

### Advanced Features
- **Machine Learning**: Predict optimal stop placement based on historical patterns
- **Dynamic Timeouts**: Adjust monitoring duration based on volatility
- **Cross-Asset Monitoring**: Extend to options, futures, and crypto
- **Real-time Analytics**: Performance metrics and execution quality tracking

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Backtesting
```python
# Enable test mode for backtesting synthetic logic
self.test_live_logic = 1  # Simulates Schwab rejections in backtest
```
