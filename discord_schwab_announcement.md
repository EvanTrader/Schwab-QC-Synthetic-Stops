## üéØ Schwab-Specific: Synthetic Stops Solution Now Open Source

Hey Schwab traders! üè¶

I know we've all been frustrated with Schwab's stop order restrictions. Well, I've finally open-sourced the solution I've been using in production.

### The Schwab Problem
We all know the drill:
- Place stop order ‚Üí Schwab rejects with "stop price must be outside bid-ask spread"
- Risk management breaks down
- Have to use market orders (worse execution)
- Manual monitoring is impossible

### My Solution: Synthetic Stops
**High-frequency monitoring** that automatically handles Schwab rejections:

```python
# Schwab rejects your stop order
if order_event.Message.Contains("stop price must be"):
    # Automatically add to synthetic monitoring
    synthetic_stops.handle_entry_rejection(symbol, target_price, quantity)
```

### How It Works
1. **Detects Schwab rejections** by message content
2. **Adds high-resolution data** (second resolution) for monitoring
3. **Places stop market orders** when bid/ask tightens
4. **Executes market orders** when price crosses target
5. **Validates positions** and handles timeouts

### Schwab-Specific Features
- **Message pattern matching** for Schwab's rejection format
- **Bid/ask spread analysis** for optimal stop placement
- **Schwab API integration** through QuantConnect
- **Timeout handling** for full trading day coverage

### Performance on Schwab
- **Only activates** when Schwab rejects orders
- **Second-resolution monitoring** for precise execution
- **Better fills** than immediate market orders
- **Guaranteed execution** when Schwab blocks stops

### What's Included
- **Complete Python implementation** for QuantConnect
- **ORB strategy example** with Schwab integration
- **Schwab-specific configuration** and error handling
- **Production-ready code** with comprehensive logging

### Integration Example
```python
# Set up Schwab brokerage
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.CharlesSchwab, AccountType.Margin)

# Initialize synthetic stops
self.synthetic_stops = SchwabSyntheticStops(self)

# Handle rejections automatically
def OnOrderEvent(self, order_event):
    if order_event.Status == OrderStatus.Invalid:
        if self.synthetic_stops.is_schwab_rejection(order_event.Message):
            self.synthetic_stops.handle_entry_rejection(...)
```

### Schwab Trading Benefits
- **No more rejected stops** - synthetic monitoring handles it
- **Better execution quality** - stop orders when possible
- **Risk management works** - stops execute as intended
- **Strategy compatibility** - works with any approach

### Real-World Results
